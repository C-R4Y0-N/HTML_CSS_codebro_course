    <pre>         Another day is like a new beginning
        And so today i know that it's a new start
        I know the bad times are disappearing
        Cause now i know that we'll never be apart
        
        You're the one that makes me feel so high
        Just like the diamonds in the sky
        I never want to hear you say goodbye
        Cause you're my diamond in the sky
        
        You're the one that makes me feel so high
        Just like the diamonds in the sky
        I never want to hear you say goodbye
        Cause you're my diamond in the sky
        
        Another road that we must travel
        Another night for you to show me the way
        And so today, i give up dreaming
        Cause now i know, i need you everyday
        
        You're the one that makes me feel so high
        Just like the diamonds in the sky
        I never want to hear you say goodbye
        Cause you're my diamond in the sky
        
        You're the one that makes me feel so high
        Just like the diamonds in the sky
        I never want to hear you say goodbye
        Cause you're my diamond in the sky
        
        Where do all the rainbows go?
        To somewhere i don't know
        Wherever it is, i want to go
        
        Ohhh..
        Wherever it is i want to go
        
        Feel so high...
        Feel so high!
        
        You're the one that makes me feel so high
        Just like the diamonds in the sky
        I never want to hear you say goodbye
        Cause you're my diamond in the sky
        
        You're the one that makes me feel so high
        Just like the diamonds in the sky
        I never want to hear you say goodbye
        Cause you're my diamond in the sky</pre>
