        Living in the city
        You know you have to survive
        (Living in the city)
        You've got to keep that dream alive
        (Living in the city)
        Where everything is free
        (Living in the city)
        Can't you see

        Living in the city
        You know you have to survive
        (Living in the city)
        You've got to keep that dream alive
        (Living in the city)
        Where everything is free
        (Living in the city)
        Can't you see

        So many different things to see
        There's no time
        So many different things to do
        But there's no time
        So many people all around
        So many feeling to be found
        Living in a city where no one lets you down

        Living in the city
        You know you have to survive
        (Living in the city)
        You've got to keep that dream alive
        (Living in the city)
        Where everything is free
        (Living in the city)
        Can't you see

        Living in the city
        You know you have to survive
        (Living in the city)
        You've got to keep that dream alive
        (Living in the city)
        Where everything is free
        (Living in the city)
        Can't you see

        So many things that we've been through
        Can you feel it
        So many things for us to do
        But can you feel it
        So many faces all around
        So many places to be found
        Living in a city where nothing gets you down

        Living in the city
        You know you have to survive
        (Living in the city)
        You've got to keep that dream alive

        (Living in the city)
        Can't you see

        In the sky at night
        The stars are shinin' bright
        You can see the city lights
        Cause I'm here to make it right

        In the city
