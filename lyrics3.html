        Sometimes I ask myself, what am I doin' here?
        I think of all the reasons, but it's still not clear
        I look at places to go, there's nothing near
        So take me away from this, 'cause this place I'll hardly miss

        So take me back in time to another world
        When you can be mine, we don't have to worry
        When you're by my side, there's nothing I don't know
        There's nothing to decide apart from where we want to go

        What am I doing now by coming back for more?
        Is it me, or have I been here before?
        I want to go somewhere that we can explore
        Just take me away from here to somewhere that's nowhere near
        
        So take me back in time to another world
        When you can be mine, we don't have to worry
        When you're by my side, there's nothing I don't know
        There's nothing to decide apart from where we want to go
