        Can you see? The sun is shinin' on me
        It makes me feel so free, so alive
        It makes me want to survive

        And the sky, it makes me feel so high
        The bad times pass me by
        'Cause today is gonna be a brighter day

        Can you feel the sunshine?
        Does it brighten up your day?
        Don't you feel that sometimes
        You just need to run away?
        Reach out for the sunshine
        Forget about the rain
        Just think about the good times
        And they will come back again
        Feel the sunshine...

        Without you, there's nothing for me to do
        Can you feel the sunshine, too?
        It's comin' through; it makes me feel brand new

        When you're here, I wish you were always near
        'Cause everything's so clear
        And today is gonna be a brighter day

        Can you feel the sunshine?
        Does it brighten up your day?
        Don't you feel that sometimes
        You just need to run away?
        Reach out for the sunshine
        Forget about the rain
        Just think about the good times
        And they will come back again

        When the sun goes down
        I feel like I am waiting
        For another day
        When the clouds go away

        Can you feel it?
        Ooh-hoo...
        Can you feel it?
        Oh...

        Can you feel it?
        Oh...
        Can you feel it?

        Can you feel the sunshine?
        Does it brighten up your day?
        Brighten up your day...
        Don't you feel that sometimes
        We just need to run away?
        Reach out for the sunshine
        Forget about the rain
        Just think about the good times
        And they will come back again

        Can you feel the sunshine?
        Does it brighten up your day?
        Brighten up your day...
        Don't you feel that sometimes
        You just need to run away?
        You just need to run away...
        Reach out for the sunshine
        Forget about the rain
        Just think about the good times
        And they will come back again
        
        Can you feel the sunshine?
        Can you feel it?
        Does it brighten up your day?
        Brighten up your day...
        Don't you feel that sometimes
        We just need to run away?
        Need to run away...
        Reach out for the sunshine
